# RideTranscriber
An OpenRCT2 Plugin that takes a ride and returns a sequential list of all track pieces.

TODO:

- Add handling for rides that are not full circuits.
- Add parsing for the track objects into more readable descriptions (for example "Downward-Gentle Unbanked to Level Banked-Left")
- Return the ride transcript to something other than console.log (either a text file or an in-game window you can copy from)
